# raytracer
Raytracer to calculate absorption, reflection and transmission for 3D structures with multilayer thin film coatings.
Geometrical raytracing: rays are traced for 3D structures including absorptive materials.
Wave optic calculation: optical interference is calculated for multilayer thin film structures.
